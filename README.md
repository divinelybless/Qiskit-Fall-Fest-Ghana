# Qiskit-Fall-Fest-Ghana
Hello!

You're looking at the repository for the Introductory to Quantum Computing Workshop on October 30, 2023 to November 3, 2023.

The theme for this workshop is **Qiskit Fall Fest Ghana: Quantum Computing for Social Good**.

The repository contains all the Jupyter notebooks which make up the workshop (including exercises)

## Course overview

**Online lectures**: 14:00 to 16:00 UTC on Monday to Fridays.

**Challenge**: Friday at 14:00 to 16: 00 UTC.

**Deadline of Submission of Lab Assignment**: 23:59 UTC on Friday, November 3, 2023. 



The course is taught over a number of sessions, with each session introducing a new set of topics. Each session has an associated Jupyter notebook (see below) which contains background information introducing you to the topic and a set of exercises for you to work through.
